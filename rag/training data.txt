Here are some common washing machine problems and solutions achievable by the customer:

1. Machine Won't Turn On

Problem: The machine doesn't power on at all.
Solutions:
Check the power cord: Ensure it's plugged securely into both the wall outlet and the machine.
Verify wall outlet: Make sure the outlet is working by plugging in another appliance. Check if a breaker tripped by testing other appliances on the same circuit.
Check door closure: Some machines have safety features that prevent them from starting with an open door. Firmly close the washer door.


2. Machine Not Filling With Water

Problem: The machine starts the cycle but doesn't fill with water.
Solutions:
Water supply:
Verify the water supply taps are fully open for both hot and cold (if applicable).
Check for kinked or blocked hoses that might restrict water flow.
Inlet valve screen: Consult the user manual to locate the inlet valve screen (usually near the water inlet hoses). Clean any debris trapped in the screen.


3. Machine Not Draining or Spinning

Problem: The machine completes the wash cycle but doesn't drain the water or spin the clothes.
Solutions:
Drain hose: Check for any kinks or blockages in the drain hose. Straighten it if necessary.
Drain filter: Some machines have a built-in drain filter that can trap debris. Locate the filter using the user manual and clean it according to the instructions.
Excessive suds: If the machine is overflowing with suds, it might be due to using too much detergent. Rerun a drain and spin cycle without adding detergent to remove excess suds.


4. Machine Vibrates Excessively During Spin Cycle

Problem: The machine shakes violently during the spin cycle.
Solutions:
1.Uneven load: Ensure clothes are evenly distributed in the drum. An unbalanced load can cause excessive vibration.
Steps to Check for Uneven Load:
Step 1: Pause the wash cycle and open the machine.
Step 2: Redistribute the clothes evenly around the drum. If you have heavy items like towels or blankets, make sure they are balanced with lighter items.
Step 3: Restart the spin cycle and observe if the vibration decreases.

2.Leveling: Check if the machine is level. Most washing machines have adjustable feet that allow you to level the machine on an uneven floor.
steps to ensure the Machine is Level:
Step 1: Check if the washing machine is sitting evenly on the floor. You can use a spirit level for accuracy.
Step 2: Adjust the feet of the washing machine. 
Step 3: Once the machine is level, tighten the locking nuts (if available) to secure the feet in place.
Step 4: Run the spin cycle again to check for any improvement in vibration.

5. Machine Makes Unusual Noises

Problem: The machine makes loud, unusual noises during operation.
Solutions:
Foreign objects: Check the drum and pump for any loose objects like coins, buttons, or safety pins that might be causing the noise.
Overloading: The machine might be overloaded with clothes, causing it to strain and make unusual noises. Reduce the load and try again.
